# Zoho Assessment Project

## Overview
This project is designed as a solution for a Zoho assessment. It leverages Python and Jupyter Notebook for implementation and analysis, demonstrating the ability to solve a real-world problem programmatically. The code includes data manipulation, logical operations, and specific algorithmic solutions relevant to the assessment task.

## Features
- **Data Analysis:** Performs data manipulation and computation using Python.
- **Algorithms:** Implements specific algorithms to solve given problems.
- **Visualization:** (If applicable) Provides visual insights into the data and results.
- **Modularity:** Code is structured into functions and cells for clarity and reusability.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib` (if visualization is used)

Install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## File Structure
- `Zoho Assessment.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook file containing the project code and analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: (Optional) List of dependencies for the project.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zoho-assessment.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd zoho-assessment
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Zoho Assessment.ipynb"
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code.

## Project Highlights
- **Problem Solving:** Includes logical solutions for the assessment problems.
- **Code Modularity:** Functions and cells are organized for better readability and debugging.
- **Custom Outputs:** Generates relevant outputs based on the given data and problem statement.

## Results
The project successfully solves the given assessment tasks and produces the desired outputs. Detailed results and explanations are available within the notebook.

## Future Enhancements
- Add automated tests for the implemented logic.
- Expand the project to include additional scenarios or use cases.
- Provide a standalone script version for easier execution.
